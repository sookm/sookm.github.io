I am a software engineer with development experience building web applications with ReactJS and Recoil. I also have experience taking 720 hours of courses in Data Analysis with SQL and Python. Enjoying trying new things and in new fields, I've been involved in various experiences. Being attracted to creative developers' culture and processes, I hope to collaborate with various people as well!
